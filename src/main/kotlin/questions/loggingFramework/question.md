# Designing a Logging Framework

## Requirements

1. The logging framework should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.
2. It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
3. The framework should support multiple output destinations, such as console, file, and database.
4. It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
5. The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.
6. It should be extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.

## Implementations

#### [Kotlin implementation](../loggingFramework/)

## Classes, Interfaces and Enumerations

1. The **LogLevel** enum defines the different log levels supported by the logging framework.
2. The **LogMessage** class represents a log message with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
3. The **LogAppender** interface defines the contract for appending log messages to different output destinations.
4. The **ConsoleAppender**, **FileAppender**, and **DatabaseAppender** classes are concrete implementations of the
   LogAppender interface, supporting logging to the console, file, and database, respectively.
5. The **LoggerConfig** class holds the configuration settings for the logger, including the log level and the selected
   log appender.
6. The **Logger** class is a singleton that provides the main logging functionality. It allows setting the
   configuration, logging messages at different levels, and provides convenience methods for each log level.
7. The **LoggingExample** class demonstrates the usage of the logging framework, showcasing different log levels,
   changing the configuration, and logging from multiple threads.

### Improvements and Enhancements
Thread-Safety:

The current implementation is not explicitly thread-safe, which can lead to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to log messages concurrently.
Improvement: Use synchronization mechanisms or thread-safe data structures (e.g., ConcurrentLinkedQueue for buffering log messages) to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources like appenders.
Extensibility for New Log Levels and Output Destinations:

Currently, log levels are defined in an enum, which makes it less flexible to add new levels in the future.
Improvement: Consider using a more flexible approach, like a configuration file or a more dynamic structure for log levels.
Configuration Management:

Configuration is hardcoded or set programmatically, lacking flexibility for runtime changes without code modification.
Improvement: Use a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON, or properties file) to define log levels, appenders, and other settings. This allows changes without redeploying the application.
Log Formatting and Structure:

The log messages are written as plain text without a consistent format, which can make parsing and analysis difficult.
Improvement: Introduce a LogFormatter interface that formats log messages consistently, allowing customization of the log output format.
Error Handling in Appenders:

Errors during logging (e.g., file I/O or database errors) are printed to the console, but there’s no fallback mechanism.
Improvement: Implement a fallback strategy if the primary appender fails (e.g., switch to a secondary appender or queue the logs for later).
Performance Considerations:

The current file and database appenders perform blocking I/O operations that could slow down the application.
Improvement: Use asynchronous logging or background threads to handle I/O operations, ensuring that the main application thread is not blocked.
Support for Multiple Appendings:

The current configuration allows only one appender at a time.
Improvement: Support multiple appenders simultaneously (e.g., logging to both console and file) by storing appenders in a list or collection.
Singleton Pattern Improvements:

The Singleton pattern is correctly implemented using Kotlin’s lazy, but the Logger class’s mutability can cause configuration issues in a multi-threaded environment.
Improvement: Protect configuration settings with thread-safe methods or ensure immutability where necessary.
